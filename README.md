## Backend Blogger

Backend for a blogging platform written [PHP](https://www.php.net/), using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for the [frontend](https://github.com/Julicolo/blogger-frontend).

All these files serve as an API for the frontend, so it can make ajax requests to gather blog posts, comments, likes, etc.
